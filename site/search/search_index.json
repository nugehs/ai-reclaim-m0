The application is served as static assets from S3 via CloudFront, enabling global edge caching while keeping origin data in the UK.</p> <p>Edge &amp; Security Layer: All inbound traffic passes through CloudFront and AWS WAF before reaching the application. WAF provides protection against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS), bot traffic, and DDoS attacks. This layer acts as the first line of defence for the platform.</p> <p>Application Layer: The API service acts as the single entry point for all client requests. It handles request routing, input validation, and orchestration of business services. Authentication is delegated to AWS Cognito, which manages user identities, JWT token issuance, and supports MFA for compliance requirements.</p> <p>Container Platform (ECS Fargate): All application services run as containerised microservices on AWS ECS Fargate, using Docker Hardened Images (DHI) as base images. DHI provides near-zero CVE posture, SLSA Level 3 provenance, and FIPS/STIG-compliant variants for NHS and government clients. Container images are stored in a private ECR registry within eu-west-2.</p> <p>Business Services Layer: Five domain-specific containerised services handle core platform functionality: - api-gateway \u2014 Request routing, rate limiting, JWT validation - asset-service \u2014 Asset lifecycle management from registration through disposition - audit-service \u2014 Immutable audit log entries for all significant actions - certificate-service \u2014 Destruction and recycling certificate generation - esg-service \u2014 Environmental impact calculations and reporting</p> <p>AI/ML Layer: The AI Identification Service enables users to identify IT assets by uploading photographs or scanning barcodes/serial numbers. Image analysis is performed by AWS Rekognition, with results matched against a device database. This accelerates asset registration and reduces data entry errors.</p> <p>Data Layer: PostgreSQL (RDS) serves as the primary transactional database, chosen for its ACID compliance, Row-Level Security support, and mature audit capabilities. Redis (ElastiCache) provides caching for session data and frequently-accessed queries. S3 buckets store asset images and archived audit logs with appropriate retention policies.</p>"},{"location":"COMBINED-DELIVERABLE/#3-component-specifications","title":"3.

This claim is extracted and validated on every API request, ensuring users can only access data belonging to their organisation.</p> <p>Database Level: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies automatically filter all queries by <code>organisation_id</code>. Even if application code contains a bug that omits tenant filtering, the database layer enforces isolation. This defence-in-depth approach is critical for regulated environments.</p> <p>Storage Level: S3 objects are stored with a tenant-specific prefix structure (<code>s3://bucket/{organisation_id}/...</code>). IAM policies and bucket policies restrict access to tenant-specific prefixes based on the authenticated user's organisation.</p> <p>Cache Level: Redis keys are namespaced per tenant (<code>{organisation_id}:cache_key</code>), preventing cache pollution between organisations.</p> <p>This multi-layered approach ensures that a failure at any single layer does not result in cross-tenant data exposure.</p>"},{"location":"COMBINED-DELIVERABLE/#5-design-assumptions","title":"5.

The application is served as static assets from S3 via CloudFront, enabling global edge caching while keeping origin data in the UK.</p> <p>Edge &amp; Security Layer: All inbound traffic passes through CloudFront and AWS WAF before reaching the application. WAF provides protection against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS), bot traffic, and DDoS attacks. This layer acts as the first line of defence for the platform.</p> <p>Application Layer: The API service acts as the single entry point for all client requests. It handles request routing, input validation, and orchestration of business services. Authentication is delegated to AWS Cognito, which manages user identities, JWT token issuance, and supports MFA for compliance requirements.</p> <p>Container Platform (ECS Fargate): All application services run as containerised microservices on AWS ECS Fargate, using Docker Hardened Images (DHI) as base images. DHI provides near-zero CVE posture, SLSA Level 3 provenance, and FIPS/STIG-compliant variants for NHS and government clients. Container images are stored in a private ECR registry within eu-west-2.</p> <p>Business Services Layer: Five domain-specific containerised services handle core platform functionality: - api-gateway \u2014 Request routing, rate limiting, JWT validation - asset-service \u2014 Asset lifecycle management from registration through disposition - audit-service \u2014 Immutable audit log entries for all significant actions - certificate-service \u2014 Destruction and recycling certificate generation - esg-service \u2014 Environmental impact calculations and reporting</p> <p>AI/ML Layer: The AI Identification Service enables users to identify IT assets by uploading photographs or scanning barcodes/serial numbers. Image analysis is performed by AWS Rekognition, with results matched against a device database. This accelerates asset registration and reduces data entry errors.</p> <p>Data Layer: PostgreSQL (RDS) serves as the primary transactional database, chosen for its ACID compliance, Row-Level Security support, and mature audit capabilities. Redis (ElastiCache) provides caching for session data and frequently-accessed queries. S3 buckets store asset images and archived audit logs with appropriate retention policies.</p>"},{"location":"01-system-architecture/#3-component-specifications","title":"3.

This claim is extracted and validated on every API request, ensuring users can only access data belonging to their organisation.</p> <p>Database Level: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies automatically filter all queries by <code>organisation_id</code>. Even if application code contains a bug that omits tenant filtering, the database layer enforces isolation. This defence-in-depth approach is critical for regulated environments.</p> <p>Storage Level: S3 objects are stored with a tenant-specific prefix structure (<code>s3://bucket/{organisation_id}/...</code>). IAM policies and bucket policies restrict access to tenant-specific prefixes based on the authenticated user's organisation.</p> <p>Cache Level: Redis keys are namespaced per tenant (<code>{organisation_id}:cache_key</code>), preventing cache pollution between organisations.</p> <p>This multi-layered approach ensures that a failure at any single layer does not result in cross-tenant data exposure.</p>"},{"location":"01-system-architecture/#5-design-assumptions","title":"5.
